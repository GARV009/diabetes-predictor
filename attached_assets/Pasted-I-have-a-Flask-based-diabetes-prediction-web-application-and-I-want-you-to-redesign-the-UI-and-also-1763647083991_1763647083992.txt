I have a Flask-based diabetes prediction web application, and I want you to redesign the UI and also implement or fix ALL backend functionalities corresponding to every UI feature.

Build a modern, responsive, production-ready UI AND ensure the backend has full logic, routes, models, utilities, and API endpoints for everything in the interface.

✅ Project Functionalities to Fully Implement

You must create or complete both UI and backend for:

1. Diabetes Prediction Module

UI:

Inputs: glucose, insulin, BMI, age

Result display

Interactive charts (BMI bar, glucose doughnut, risk bar)

Backend:

Route to process prediction request

Load SVC model

Return prediction + risk metrics

JSON endpoints for all charts

2. Personalized Diet Planner

UI:

Daily calorie target

Macro breakdown UI

Meal recommendations (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks)

Foods to avoid

7-day meal schedule

Personalized health tips

Backend:

Calorie calculator function

Macro ratio generator

Meal suggestion engine

Food categories and avoid-list logic

7-day plan generation

Tip generation logic

Backend API returning all values in JSON

3. Health Checkup Recommendations

UI:

BP input + result

Recommended blood tests (essential / recommended / optional)

Doctor visit frequency

Test frequency schedule

Family history indicators

Backend:

BP analysis algorithm

Rule-based test recommendation engine

Doctor visit interval function

Test scheduling logic

Family history risk evaluation

JSON/API endpoint to feed UI

4. Interactive Visualizations (Chart.js)

Build UI containers and backend data routes for:

BMI bar chart

Glucose doughnut chart

Diabetes risk bar

Nutrition breakdown pie chart

Health timeline chart (glucose + BMI from DB)

Backend:

Endpoints returning chart data in JSON

DB queries for historical data

5. User Authentication + Profiles

UI:

Login

Register

Profile page

Backend:

Flask-Login integration

Input validation

Password hashing

Protected routes

6. Health History Dashboard

UI:

Table of last 10 entries

Trend charts

Color-coded risk status

Backend:

Save health records to DB

Fetch recent records

Risk evaluation logic

History API endpoint

7. Gamification System

UI:

Points

Streaks

Badges

Progress section

Backend:

Logic for awarding points

Daily streak calculation

Badge assignment (5 badges)

API returning gamification stats

8. Chatbot Feature

UI:

Chatbox with user / bot messages

Backend:

Rule-based conversational engine

Provide structured responses (diet, glucose, stress, sleep, exercise, medications)

JSON endpoint to return reply

✅ UI Requirements

Modern medical-themed style (whites, pastel blues/greens)

Fully responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile)

Dashboard layout with sidebar/top-nav

Clean components: cards, grids, charts, icons

Tailwind, Bootstrap, or custom CSS allowed

Smooth transitions & modern spacing

✅ Backend Requirements

Clean Flask structure (blueprints preferred)

SQLAlchemy ORM

Models for User, HealthRecord, Gamification

All routes must validate data and return JSON or render templates

Use a modular, scalable project layout

Deliverables

✔ Complete UI (HTML/CSS/JS) for all pages
✔ Backend Flask routes for all UI forms
✔ Chart.js data endpoints
✔ Updated models, utilities, and DB logic
✔ Fully functional user authentication
✔ All gamification + chatbot logic implemented
✔ Health history + recommendations + diet planner fully functional
